    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
    Born in Hong Kong and raised in Richmond Hill, Ontario, I currently split my
    time between Greater Toronto and Greater Boston. I'm a musician,
    theatre-maker, linguist, and multioriented researcher currently pursuing a
    master's degree in Linguistics and a bachelor's degree in
    Comparative Literature and Mathematics,
    with minors in Computer Science and French, at Harvard University (if you
    want to know more about my college career, click <a href="/college.html">
    here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
    Though my interests are very widespread, I find myself particularly drawn to
    the intersection between <b>effective, creative communication</b> and
    <b>equitable representation</b>. I'm interested in understanding the ways in
    which we humans are able to tell stories and interact with one another,
    across all sorts of creative and analytical media — and how these are ultimately
    influenced and mediated by our identities and our culture. The research that
    I undertake and the art that I create serve to grapple with different facets
    of this complex idea. With them, I hope to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>stress the <b>necessity of showcasing and celebrating underrepresented
      voices</b> in the arts and in research;</li>
      <li>remind us of the <b>crucial role of art-making in community-building,
      </b> from its ability to ask critical questions to its unique power
      to inspire empathy; and</li>
      <li>contribute to <b>multidisciplinary discourse</b> in a world that is
      becoming increasingly stratified.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In <a href="/music.html">music</a>, you'll find me primarily as a <b>composer</b>.
    My compositions have been performed across Canada and the United States by
    ensembles including the <a href="http://www.hrcm.org/">Harvard-Radcliffe
    Collegium Musicum</a>, <a href="https://www.eporchestra.ca/">Etobicoke
    Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, <a href="https://www.spo.ca/">Scarborough
    Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, and <a href="https://www.sneakpeekorchestra.com/">
    Sneak Peek Orchestra</a>. I'm also a <b>conductor, vocalist, pianist</b>,
    and (less often) a violinist and percussionist.
    </p>
    <p>
    In <a href="/theatre.html">theatre</a>, I'm an avid <b>music director and
    composer</b> of musical theatre, though I've also served as a finance producer.
    I've worked professionally as a music director and orchestrator for the
    <a href="https://americanrepertorytheater.org/">American Repertory Theater
    </a> and have had projects sponsored by the
    <a href="https://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/">Office of the Arts at Harvard</a>.
    I've also taken part in the Writers' Workshop at Toronto's
    <a href="https://www.newmusictheatreintensives.ca/">New Music Theatre
    Intensives.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    In <a href="/research.html">research</a>, I'm primarily interested in
    <b>linguistics</b> (especially historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and
    pragmatics) and <b>literature</b> (especially contemporary Anglophone and
    Francophone Asian-diasporic poetry and drama). I'm a Carol K. Pforzheimer
    Fellow at the <a href="https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/">Radcliffe
    Institute for Advanced Study</a> and a member of Harvard's
    <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/meaningandmodality/home">
    Meaning and Modality Linguistics Laboratory</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my free time, I love learning languages! I'm fluent in English and
    French and proficient in Cantonese and Mandarin; I also have reading
    knowledge of Spanish, and am working on my German and Italian!
    I love trying new food, with a special penchant for dessert and
    even more special penchant for fresh-squeezed orange juice. Beyond that,
    you can probably find me reading, singing, or playing Nintendo video games.
